# effect-todos

An example [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com) app built with React, [@effect-atom/atom-react](https://github.com/tim-smart/effect-atom) and Tanstack Router.

Persistence is WIP, currently a HTTP backend built with [@effect-platform HTTP API](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/platform#http-api) with an in-memory store. SQLite persistence on the roadmap.
